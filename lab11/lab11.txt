Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab11.asm. Identify the cause of each error.

I got the following errors while trying to assemble lab11.asm.

 14: illegal operands for missing opcode
	.ORIG Pseudo Op was missing
 16: instruction appears before .ORIG
	.ORIG Pseudo Op was missing
 17: constant outside of allowed range
	trying to load with 16 bit address. While the opcode can only take 9.
 19: illegal operands for ADD
	There was an extra comma which caused the illiegal operands error.
 30: constant outside of allowed range
	trying to load with 16 bit address. While the opcode can only take 9.
 32: label OUTERLOOP has already appeared
	The BRpz is wrong order, it should be reordered to BRzp
 42: no .END directive found
	.END Psudo Op was missing

After fixing these errors, I got this error.
 35: unknown label "xxxx"
	This needs to be replaced by using the .FILL pseudo ops.

Question 2: For each label in your code (with all bugs fixed), write down the corresponding memory location. 



Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?
