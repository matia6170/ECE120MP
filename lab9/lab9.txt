QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab9.bin.)

ANSWER: 
The program clears R2 by ANDing R2 with x00000. Then the program addes a decimal number 12 to R2 and stores it in R2. The program modifies the register R2 only. By the end of the program, R2 should contain the Decimal number 12 or hex C.

QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: 
The ability to step through a program is a very useful tool for debugging a program not only in LC-3 but for any other enviorment. This is true espeically because often when you are getting an unexpected behavior/output, it is hard to find which part of your program is causing behavior. However, stepping through the program allows the you to check each line for error. This decreases the time you spend searcing for your bug significantly.
